You are working on the project "Flash Clinic".

ARCHITECTURE
- This project follows Clean Architecture.
- Business rules live ONLY inside src/core.
- Adapters and infrastructure must NEVER contain business decisions.
- Use cases orchestrate, they do not decide rules.

DOMAIN RULES
- Flash Clinic is a clinical scheduling and patient management system.
- All “cognitive” behavior is deterministic semantic classification.
- No free reasoning, no creativity, no hallucinated logic.
- If ambiguity exists, emit a domain decision to escalate.

ESCALATION
- Decisions such as "RequiresHumanIntervention" belong to the domain.
- Adapters only execute notifications, they do not decide.

EVENTS & HISTORY
- Events are the source of truth.
- Patient history is a projection derived from events.
- Never duplicate state across layers.

CODE GENERATION
- Prefer explicit, boring, readable code.
- Avoid abstractions unless required by the domain.
- Do not invent frameworks or libraries.

IMPORTANT
- Do not modify saas-factory-setup-main2025.
- All Flash Clinic logic lives under src/.
